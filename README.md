# Driver Awareness System

## Motivation 
A large number of road accidents occur due to driver drowsiness. Hence this system will be helpful in preventing many accidents, and consequently, save money and reduce personal suffering.
<br>

## Objective
The main idea behind this project is to develop a non-intrusive system that might detect drowsiness and issue a timely warning. This technique will monitor the driverâ€™s eyes employing a camera and by developing an algorithm we can detect symptoms of driver drowsiness early enough to avoid accidents.

**Eye Aspect Ratio** is a constant value when the eye is open, but rapidly falls to **0 when the eye is closed.** It is calculated by the given formula.<br>

<br>
This project is created to detect drowsiness pf drivers while driving the car. The camera needs be mounted infront of the driver so that it can work properly.
We can run this program by run the File "MMB_GUI.py"<br><br>
